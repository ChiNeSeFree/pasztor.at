            <h3>Hello, I'm Janos, and I'm a DevOps Engineer.</h3>
            <p>
                I love experimenting with technologies, and I have a blast coming up with unusual, but at the same time
                quite inovative solutions to problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a strong background of both development and operations, I have a tendency to go for the less
                traveled road. While this usually takes a longer time than the traditional systems, it has a potential
                to be better and easier to maintain. 
            </p>
