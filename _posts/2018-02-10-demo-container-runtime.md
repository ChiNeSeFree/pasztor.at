This container engine has been specifically built to learn Linux containerization from. The high level details are
described in [Under the hood of Docker](/blog/under-the-hood-of-docker) and
[Docker 101: Anatomy](/blog/docker-101-anatomy) and this repo contains the nitty-gritty details.

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/janoszen/demo-container-runtime) contains a readme file in every directory,
explaining in detail how that aspect of containerization works. Go check it out!
