title:         "What’s under the hood of Docker? Process separation in the Linux kernel"
date:          2018-01-13 00:00:00
categories:    speaking
excerpt:       Have you ever wondered how Docker does what it does? How can you run “cheap” virtual machines without the added overhead of running a true virtualization? Have you ever wondered what all this talk about cgroups, namespaces, and what not is? Join the talk and learn how the new Linux kernel features sparked the container revolution, and how these things actually work. This talk will contain some C code, but fear not, we will keep it simple. This is something every DevOps Engineer working with containers should understand.
