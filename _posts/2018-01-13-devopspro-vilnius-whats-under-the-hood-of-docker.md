DevOps Pro Vilnius was one of the best conferences I've been to. Not only did the conference organizers do everything in
their power to make us feel welcome, they also did an excellent job at picking my fellow speakers. I had a blast 
talking about how Docker works under the hood and what the individual features in the Linux kernel are it uses to
achieve process level separation. The organizers even had enough forethought to put
[Phil Estes'](https://twitter.com/estesp) talk on container security directly after mine, letting us link our talks
together.

My slides can be found on the link below and the video will be up in a few weeks.
