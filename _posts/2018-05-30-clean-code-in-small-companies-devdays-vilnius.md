Clean Code is hard, especially when there’s a business need to rapidly deliver websites or web applications in small
companies or teams. This talk takes you from a traditional MVC web application – having your database calls directly in
your controller – to an architecture that is clean, easy to maintain and lends itself to getting started in having
automated tests. Not only that, but we will also borrow concepts from functional programming and make use of them in an
object oriented environment for cleaner code.
