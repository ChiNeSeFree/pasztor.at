Docker is the hot new thing, the technology that really brought the DevOps movement to a next level. Every other week a new tool comes out that claims to make Docker easier to use, but information and good advice is often hard to come by.
This workshop aims to teach you how to use Docker from the ground up, from setting up your very first Docker container to getting your containers production ready.

## Agenda

1. What is Docker?
   - How do containers work?
   - Why use containers and how do they compare to other tools?
   - Why you need to build your own containers
   - Setting up your Docker workflow
2. Building your first Docker container
   - Dockerizing your first service
   - Layering your containers on top of each other
3. Using multiple services
   - Running multiple services in one container
   - Running multiple services in separate containers
   - Coordinating multiple services with docker-compose
4. Sharing your containers
   - Setting up and using a Docker Registry
   - Using a Continuous Integration to build Docker Containers
5. Getting Docker into production
   - Production the simple way: docker-compose
   - The new contender: Using Docker Swarm
   - The mainstream: Using Kubernetes
